**Question 2.1**   
Most frequencies falls within 0.4-0.6. The histogram shows a peak at 0.4 and decreases gradually from the center to both sides.  
    
The shape of the histogram is bascially consistent with expectation, but the peak is expected to be at 0.5, not 0.4. The reason is that if the yeast undergoes random recombination, the allele frequencies should have the peak at 0.5. However, such a deviation of peak position is also reasonable since only 10 sequencing samples are counted.    
   
This follows binomial distribution.    
   
**Question 2.2**  
Most read depths are below 10. The histogram shows a peak at 5 and decreases rapidly from 5 to both sides.    
   
It represents that most genes of most samples are aligned less than 10 times.    
    
This histogram looks as expected.    
   
This follows binomial distribution.
